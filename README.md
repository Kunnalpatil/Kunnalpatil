- Hi, I’m Kunal Patil
- Your Friendly Neighbourhood Data Wrangler, a supposed master at turning dumpster-fire datasets into "actionable insights" for business growth—because buzzwords pay the bills. I juggle Python, SQL, and overhyped machine learning/generative AI tricks, excelling at predictive modeling and stats so dazzling they might actually mean something. With cutting-edge AI and a knack for spotting trends (or mirages), I churn out "impactful" solutions and innovative strategies that sound brilliant—results may vary. Peek at my GitHub if you’re brave enough.
